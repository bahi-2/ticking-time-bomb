# Ticking Time Bomb

[This web site](https://fast-refuge-77205.herokuapp.com) is a work in progress. When it is finished it will encrypt a text on the server and save it on a blockchain along side with a specified time. When this time passes the server will load the message from the blockchain, decrypt it and make it publicly available.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:heroku/node-js-getting-started.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd node-js-getting-started
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
